# *Phone-Grown* : How to transform an old smartphone into a 'smart' drawing

Phone-Grown is a project that aims to repurpose 'obsolete' phones into personal artefacts of the future home. It is built on Google Sheets, which allows full control and transparency. Follow along to explore what home-grown artefacts you can create around an old phone, or contribute to the project here on GitHub.

NOTE: THIS REPO, AS WELL AS THE README, IS IN PROGRESS - NO STABLE RELEASE AVAILABLE YET
```

## Ingredients
You will need:
- An 'obsolete' phone or tablet (that can connect to the Wi-Fi)
- A computer/laptop to set things up
- A Google Account for Google Sheets
- Some creativity and basic materials (e.g. paper, pencils)

## How To
- We are going to make

DISCLAIMER!
 - Own risk, keeping a charger plugged in. Becomes / stays hot? Stop this. Secutiry as well. Stay safe. Etc. COmmon sense.
```


### Step 1: Prepare the 'obsolete' phone
You can follow along with a phone of any age, as long as it can connect to the Wi-Fi, can be charged and has a screen (but it can be cracked!). In any case, since we are connecting it to the Internet, we need to do ensure some level of security.

#### Update to the latest security settings

Most phones do not receive security updates after ~3 years[^security] and become vulnerable for security breaches and 'hacks'. If you are not using the phone for any other purposes, we suggest to 'factory reset' your phone. **This will delete all files, apps and data on the phone**, and can often be done from the phone's `Settings` menu. Whether you did a factory reset or not, it is always good practice to update the software and security updates to the latest version (as far as it goes). Here is how to do that for [Android](https://support.google.com/android/answer/7680439?hl=en-GB) or [iOS](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204204).

#### Keep the screen awake

As we want the phone to visibly respond to incoming data, we need to keep the screen awake. On Android phones, we need to enable `developer` options by tapping 7 times on the `build number` in *Settings > About Phone*. Then in `Developer Options` turn on **Stay Awake when charging**. For iOS devices, we can set the **Auto-Lock** to `Never`, which you can find in *Settings > Display & Brightness*. See more info how to do this for [Android](https://www.howto-connect.com/how-to-stay-awake-phone-screen-while-charging-on-android/) or [iOS](https://forums.tomsguide.com/faq/how-to-change-the-auto-lock-time-in-ios-11.19693/).

All that is left is to keep the charger plugged in at all times. Where possible, disable the `Adaptive brightness` (often in Settings > Display) and set the brightness to 100%. This will help in the visibility of the screen when we put some paper in front of it. Of course, keeping your phone plugged in and screen on full brightness consumes energy - though no more than 2kWh (or €1/£1) per year. Click the arrow below to read more.

> Keeping your screen on all the time will increase the power usage of your phone. In addition to that, the processor is not going to sleep. This is different from the modern screensavers on phones, as they use processing power and energy intelligently. Unfortunately, since we use older phones and a website instead of an app, we cannot use this approach. Instead, this tutorial requires you to keep the phone on a charger, similar to how you would Chargers that are not charging use [almost no energy](https://www.howtogeek.com/231886/tested-should-you-unplug-chargers-when-youre-not-using-them/). However, leaving your phone on the charger at all times is [not the best treatment](https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/expert-advice-on-how-to-avoid-destroying-your-phones-battery/) for the longevity of your battery. This should be fine when using an older, obsolete, phone, but might not be best if you are using a modern phone for this tutorial in the long run.
>
> **A rough calculation (2kWh, < €1/£1 per year)**\
Let's take a 'new' Samsung Galaxy S6 (2015) with a battery of 2550 mAH (3.85V). If the phone would be fully drained (and charged) each day, it would take up to 5.5 Wh, or 2 kWh per year. With a current average energy cost of [less than €0,30 / £0,30](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Electricity_price_statistics) per kWh, it would cost no more than one euro or pound each year.

## Step 2: Copy the Google Sheet and set it up  
Rather than using specially-built apps,
If you're curious, copy the Google Sheet by clicking on [this link] - the copy is then all yours! You can follow the guide inside that Google Sheet, or have a look and explore its setup. There is no coding experience required, but if you are interested feel free to poke around (it is your personal copy, and thus won’t affect the original)!


## Step 3: Connect your 'old' phone
On your old phone, visit [phonegrown.site/phone](www.phonegrown.site/phone). This website (which is hosted on the open source platform GitHub) presents you with a input field. Enter the 'ID' as shown in the Google Sheet and press connect. You should see a confirmation on the phone as well as in the Google Sheet.

[^security] For iOS devices this is roughly after 5 year since its release, for Android this is often shorter (~3 years). You can read more about [the safety of using older phones here](https://www.tomsguide.com/uk/us/old-phones-unsafe,news-24846.html?region-switch=1593506477).
