# Phone-Grown
**Transform an obsolete phone into a 'smart' display**

Phone-Grown is a project that aims to repurpose 'obsolete' phones into personal artefacts of the future home. Follow along to explore what home-grown  artefacts you can create around an old phone, or contribute to the project here on GitHub.

# Ingredients
You will need:
- An 'obsolete' phone or tablet (that can connect to the Wi-Fi)
- A computer/laptop to set things up
- Some creativity and basic materials (e.g. paper, pencils)

# How-To

## Step 1: Prepare the 'obsolete' phone
You can follow along with a phone of any age, as long as it can connect to the Wi-Fi, can be charged and has a screen (but it can be cracked!). In any case, since we are connecting it to the Internet, we need to do ensure some level of security.

### Update security

Most phones do not receive security updates after ~3 years[^security] and become vulnerable for security breaches and 'hacks'. If you are not using the phone for any other purposes, we suggest to 'factory reset' your phone. **This will delete all files, apps and data on the phone**, and can often be done from the phone's `Settings` menu. Whether you did a factory reset or not, it is always good practice to update the software and security updates to the latest version (as far as it goes). Here is how to do that for [Android](https://support.google.com/android/answer/7680439?hl=en-GB) or [iOS](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204204).

### Keep the screen awake

As we want the phone to visibly respond to incoming data, we need to keep the screen awake. On Android phones, we need to enable `developer` options by tapping 7 times on the `build number` in *Settings > About Phone*. Then in `Developer Options` turn on **Stay Awake when charging**. For iOS devices, we can set the **Auto-Lock** to `Never`, which you can find in *Settings > Display & Brightness*. See more info how to do this for [Android](https://www.howto-connect.com/how-to-stay-awake-phone-screen-while-charging-on-android/) or [iOS](https://forums.tomsguide.com/faq/how-to-change-the-auto-lock-time-in-ios-11.19693/).

> **How about the power consumption?**  
> Keeping your screen on all the time will increase the power usage of your phone. Not only is the screen on all the time (often the most power-hungry part of your phone), the processor is also not going to sleep. This is different from the modern 'Always On Display' screensavers on phones, as they use processing power and energy intelligently. Unfortunately, we cannot use this approach in this tutorial.

> [Battery degrading continuous charging](https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/expert-advice-on-how-to-avoid-destroying-your-phones-battery/) (not good, but using an old phone anyways...)

DISCLAIMER! Own risk, keeping a charger plugged in. Becomes / stays hot? Stop this. Secutiry as well. Stay safe. Etc. COmmon sense.

# Future vision
- smart use of energy (not screen always on), detecting movement (when is it relevant?), etc.
- explore reuse of other types of devices in a safe way


[^security] For iOS devices this is roughly after 5 year since its release, for Android this is often shorter (~3 years). You can read more about [the safety of using older phones here](https://www.tomsguide.com/uk/us/old-phones-unsafe,news-24846.html?region-switch=1593506477).
