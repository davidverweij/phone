## About
Do you have an (old) unused smart phone? Turn it into a smart display using Google Sheets and some pen and paper, by following this easy step-by-step tutorial. Show what you can make and support our research!

_This tutorial is developed on the Newcastle University (UK) by David Verweij, as part of his PhD research. He explores how you can be creative with technology at home in a less-technical way. Read more [here](#FAQ_about)_

## Tools & Materials
You don't need much, but you will at least need a smartphone (preferably one you don't need for a while) that can connect to your Wi-Fi.

## FAQ

### The technology bit

### Your privacy and safety

### Sustainability
Keeping your screen on all the time will undoubtedly increase the power usage of your phone. In addition to that, the processor is not going to sleep. This is different from the modern screensavers on phones, as they use processing power and energy intelligently. Unfortunately, since we use older phones and a website instead of an app, we cannot use this approach. Instead, this tutorial requires you to keep the phone on a charger, similar to how you would Chargers that are not charging use almost no energy. However, leaving your phone on the charger at all times is not the best treatment for the longevity of your battery. This should be fine when using an older, obsolete, phone, but might not be best if you are using a modern phone for this tutorial in the long run.

A rough calculation (2kWh, < €1/£1 per year)
Let's take a 'new' Samsung Galaxy S6 (2015) with a battery of 2550 mAH (3.85V). If the phone would be fully drained (and charged) each day, it would take up to 5.5 Wh, or 2 kWh per year. With a current average energy cost of less than €0,30 / £0,30 per kWh, it would cost no more than one euro or pound each year.
