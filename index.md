## About
Do you have an (old) unused smart phone? Turn it into a smart display using Google Sheets and some pen and paper, by following this easy step-by-step tutorial. Show what you can make and support our research!

_This tutorial is developed by [David Verweij](https://openlab.ncl.ac.uk/people/david-verweij/){:target="_blank"} at Newcastle University as part of his PhD research, read more [here](#about-this-research)._

## What can it do?
When you finished the tutorial, you will have turned your phone into 'smart display'. The screen of your phone will then change based on some data that you choose. For example, the screen could turn _blue when you receive an email_ or _green when Wired.com publishes a new article_. Of course, just showing colours doesn't tell you what it means - that's where some pen and paper come handy. With a little drawing placed in front of the phone you give meaning to the colours. Since we have 'split' the screen into multiple areas, you can even show multiple things at the same time. For example, you could let the _left side turn blue when it will rain_, **and** the _right side turn yellow when the temperature is high_ (see also the image at the top). Since your choice of data and your creativity with drawing allows for countless possibilities, we just can't imagine what you will use your smart display for!

## Tools & Materials you need
- A smart phone that can connect to your Wi-Fi (_preferably one you don't need for a while_)
- Some pen and paper
- A computer/laptop to set things up
- A [Google account](https://myaccount.google.com/){:target="_blank"} (_for using Google Sheets_)
- An [IFTTT.com](https://www.ifttt.com/){:target="_blank"} account (_for connecting it to data_)
