## About
Do you have an (old) unused smart phone? Turn it into a smart display using Google Sheets and some pen and paper, by following this easy step-by-step tutorial. Show what you can make and support our research!

_This tutorial is developed by David Verweij at Newcastle University as part of his PhD research, read more [here](#about-this-research)._

## What can it do?


## Tools & Materials you need
- a smartphone that can connect to your Wi-Fi (_preferably one you don't need for a while_)
- some pen and paper
- a computer/laptop to set things up
- a Google account (_for using Google Sheets_)
- an IFTTT.com account (_for connecting it to data_)

## FAQ

### About this research
For his PhD, David explores how you can be creative with technology at home in a less-technical way.

### The technology bit
A Google Sheet template with a document-bound script contains a few predefined formulas and methods. Once deployed, your copy of the Sheet (and script) gives you a personal API. A phone can then connect to that Sheet through that API. Using existing web services (e.g. IFTTT.com), numerous data sources can be hooked up to the Sheet. Based on your rules set in the UI, a flag will be set on a secure external database. The phone, which is listening to this flag, will request new instructions and output the visual design on screen - providing a push notification-like service.

### Your privacy and safety

### Sustainability
Keeping your screen on all the time will undoubtedly increase the power usage of your phone. In addition to that, the processor is not going to sleep. This is different from the modern screensavers on phones, as they use processing power and energy intelligently. Unfortunately, since we use older phones and a website instead of an app, we cannot use this approach. Instead, this tutorial requires you to keep the phone on a charger, similar to how you would Chargers that are not charging use almost no energy. However, leaving your phone on the charger at all times is not the best treatment for the longevity of your battery. This should be fine when using an older, obsolete, phone, but might not be best if you are using a modern phone for this tutorial in the long run.

A rough calculation (2kWh, < €1/£1 per year)
Let's take a 'new' Samsung Galaxy S6 (2015) with a battery of 2550 mAH (3.85V). If the phone would be fully drained (and charged) each day, it would take up to 5.5 Wh, or 2 kWh per year. With a current average energy cost of less than €0,30 / £0,30 per kWh, it would cost no more than one euro or pound each year.
