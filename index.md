## About {#about}
Do you have an (old) unused smartphone? Turn it into a smart display using Google Sheets and some pen and paper, by following this easy step-by-step tutorial. Show what you can make and support our research!

_This tutorial is developed by [David Verweij](https://openlab.ncl.ac.uk/people/david-verweij/){:target="_blank"} at Newcastle University as part of his PhD research._

## What can it do? {#whatisit}
When you finished the tutorial, you will have turned your phone into 'smart display'. The screen of your phone will then change colour based on some data that you choose. For example, the screen could turn _turn blue on the left when it will rain_, and _turn yellow on the right when the temperature is high_ (see also the picture at the top). Now, when you add a little drawing in front of your phone it shows you, and anyone else at home, what the colours mean.

Since your choice of data and your creativity with drawing allows for countless possibilities, we just can't imagine what you will use your smart display for!

## Tools & Materials you need {#materials}
- A smartphone that can connect to your Wi-Fi (_preferably one you don't need for a while_)
- Some pen and paper
- A computer/laptop to set things up
- A [Google account](https://myaccount.google.com/){:target="_blank"} (_for using Google Sheets_)
- An [IFTTT.com](https://www.ifttt.com/){:target="_blank"} account (_for connecting it to data_)
